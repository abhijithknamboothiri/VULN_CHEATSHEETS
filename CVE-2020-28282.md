# Prototype pollution vulnerability leads to RCE

## Description

Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘getobject’ version 0.1.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution. The NPM module 'getobject' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'set()' did not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.

## POC

const getObject = require('getobject');
var obj = {}; console.log("Before Polluting : " + obj.isAdmin);
getObject.set(obj, '__proto__.isAdmin', true);
console.log("After Polluting: " + obj.isAdmin);
 
## Remediation

Upgrade to version 1.0.0
